# Project CHIMERA - Hackathon Rules

## 1. Core Philosophy: "Defensive Acceleration"

- **Speed with Structure:** We are in a hackathon. Prioritize working MVPs over theoretical perfection, but maintain the clean modular architecture defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **The "Shadow Warrant" is Law:** All implementation must adhere to the core separation: `Production (Key_Prime)` vs `Honeypot (Key_Shadow)`. Never bleed contexts.

## 2. Coding Standards

- **Language:** Python 3.10+ (Asyncio preferred for IO), Rust (for perf-critical if needed).
- **Style:**
  - Minimal but informative docstrings (what, not how).
  - Type hints are mandatory (`typing.List`, `typing.Optional`).
  - No "spaghetti code" in `main.py`. Keep logic in `src/{module}/`.
- **Async First:** The IPG must be non-blocking. Use `async/await` for all I/O.

## 3. Repository Structure

- `src/ipg/`: Intelligent Protocol Gateway (Proxy logic).
- `src/nsie/`: Neural-Symbolic Inference (The "Brain" - logic & ML).
- `src/dkca/`: Dual-Key Authority (Crypto & Tokens).
- `src/vee/`: Virtual Execution Env (Docker/Sandbox config).
- `docs/`: Architecture and specs only.

## 4. Collaboration & Workflow

- **Comments:** Explain _why_ a security decision was made (e.g., "Using constant time compare to prevent timing attacks").
- **Testing:** Write simple integration tests (`tests/`) that prove the "Happy Path" and the "Attack Path".
- **No Over-Engineering:** If a simple regex works for the hackathon, don't train a Transformer (yet).

## 5. Hackathon Shortcuts (Allowed vs Forbidden)

- **Allowed:** Hardcoding keys for local dev, using SQLite instead of Postgres, using Docker Compose for orchestration.
- **Forbidden:** Committing real secrets, skipping the "Shadow" routing logic (the core value prop), mixing production/shadow data.

## 6. Tooling

- Use `codebase_search` to find context before asking.
- Use `run_terminal_cmd` to verify implementations immediately.
